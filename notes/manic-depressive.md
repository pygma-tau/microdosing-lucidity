title: Manic-Depressive
---

Manic:

- high energy, low focus
- inexorable drive towards insight meditation
- unreasonable optimism, w.r.t. planning and events
- medium-shallow. shallow in nature (as opposed to deep), but in practice doesn't actually showcase its lack of deepness that often
- libido is proportional to masturbation (3-4x daily)
- more generally impulse control for {food, sex, affection} is hard but baseline easier than it is normally, & self-awareness comes much more naturally. desire is higher though
- w/focus (sometimes w/stims), highly productive
- antsy, intellectually and physically. should experiment w/gym
- secure attachment, edging to avoidant but typically not
- happiness, joy, high amt of sensations, emotional range of a teaspoon (at worst), non-coercive {self-control, casualness, optimism, healthy behavior (sometimes)}, obsession w/world
- I do more math / code more

Depressive:

- low energy, higher focus? but identical activation energy to focus, so still basically no focus
- concentration meditation is lax. object is tinged w/sadness, prone to crying fits / rumination
- low self-esteem, marked inability to be excited about future, somewhat similar to falling down Maslow's hierarchy (but with no apparent reason?)
- *higher* libido but less ability to masturbate (~1x daily)
- lower innate drive for cheap gratification but higher consumption of cheap gratification (much lower capacity to appreciate higher pleasures, cheap gratification is cheap for a reason and requires less energy)
- feel touch-starvation much more acutely. hypothesis that this is the proximate cause but unclear
- loneliness, sadness, perception of unlovedness, scarcity mindset, anxiety, markedly higher neuroticism although this is at odds w/low-energy, coercive self-control (vv powerful), high sensitivity, high emotional range (on the negative side), obsession w/self
- I write more

The concept of a "normal" equilibrium state is mostly foreign to me. "Normality" is just some combination of the two, and the continual cycle is (from baseline) increasing happiness until manic peak, stay there at some sustainable level for anywhere between 2hrs and 3wks, then slowly w/eggshell-breaking retreat to depressive state & exist there for a while. Slowly climb back up and repeat

is a bit like Icarus flying too close to the sun, falling down into the ocean, getting back up and flying again, and inadvertently flying near the sun (& the sun burns him?). 

> feel touch-starvation much more acutely. hypothesis that this is the proximate cause but unclear

my working hypothesis is that physical touch / affection co-regulates this particular cycle quite well. Something something increases baseline such that depressive states aren't quite as bad, and fuel to maintain stuff that's nearer manic and make it sustainable?  

Interventions that work to varying degrees (when depressed, when manic mostly have the capacity to listen to gut):

- sunlight / exercise / food / water are (not really) necessary but JESUS CHRIST NOT SUFFICIENT conditions to feel good. best case scenario they're stop-gap measures that allow for 1-2 (maybe 3) hours of focused work each time, and then mind gets dragged back to the metaphorical gutter. 
- thinking about the emotional source really hard: of varying degrees of success. dealing with it near fully likely involves invoking a lot of physiological processes (crying) w/low success rate. rumination doesn't work, kids. using the self as a crutch to victimize oneself also doesn't work, kids. even using the self as a repository /sense-making tool to try to understand what makes you sad is *still* doomed to fail (in an emotional sense, not a true one) because you lack control over your internal processes
    - (to be clear, I still believe the self is a useful and correct abstraction. you just have to delude yourself into believing it doesn't exist from the perspective of your personal narrative)
    - this is also rough bc in the cases where there is in fact something bothering you you do need to deal with it, esp. if it involves someone close to you (your partner), but managing to articulate it sanely is hard (Extreme difficulty level when partner doesn't have capacity, often best action is simply retreat & construct shell)
- <u>Subordination:</u> there's a sense in which when I am manic, I do things because I want to---but when I am depressed, I do things because I must. The highest good for manic ppl is joy, the highest good for depressed ppl is duty (good in the good=true sense). So, I've found high ROI in placing metaphorical shackles on? Like the best thing to do here is somehow make your depressed selve a mindless drone of your (hopefully still existent) super-ego
    - this is a useful stop-gap measure for making sure you're still productive professionally. YMMV when using it for more emotional things (e.g., providing emotional support to your partner when you don't have capacity). I still think that some version of this is actually the fuel for having emotional capacity & space for your partner (at least as a man, cc DY), but is difficult to use it & not let it kill you
    - duty compounds---if you do your duty a lot, it's much easier for you to do your duty again in a non-coercive way. if you fail, you can be kind of fucked for a bit, but should be possible for you to get back up (is hard). if you fuck up, you also lose all moralizing capacity (self-perceived loss, not widely perceived loss), which can be good and bad
    - difficult to do without disembodying oneself. Strong minds can hold the duty and body in tension, & this is how Great art is made, but if one is not strong enough then you can retreat into your mind. beware, because this means that when you climb back down you will have unknown unknowns to deal with that you were not tracking
- <u>Physical Grooming</u>: physically grooming oneself (bathing, teeth cleaning, hair brushing) is by default a sensate experience? if ritualized then perhaps helpful for escaping depressed hellscape, but this is a somewhat risky endeavour to rely on because it requires high amounts of executive function & energy. that said, it is necessary to be a member of civilized society, and cultivating the internal sense of cleanliness as a virtue (not uncleanliness as a sin!! sin-coercion is Bad and should be Avoided, creates unnecessary emotional & cognitive blockage) is good. Your more normal self will thank you later if you figure out ways to keep good habits, but also it is really hard sometimes and in such cases you should default to minimum viable physical grooming & use one of the other strategies here to achieve that.
- <u>Emotional Grooming</u>: basically, the stuff you have to deal with are the parasites that are latching onto your skin at various points & creating shells around you. ripping off the shells works sometimes, but it's really hard to get your fingers around them and often molting is actually just a natural process. and I *still* haven't figured out how to sever the parasites from the anchor points. soooooo, unless you happen to be in the molting process or have wayyy too much time on your hands, consider:
    - concentrating on a very strong, *acute, localized* sensation. acute pain is the best for this, but only attempt when you have a sane relationship with self-inflicted pain. melancholy is NOT a good object for this. DO NOT TRY. likewise, happiness is also not a good object for this. beauty is! joy is! that weird torturous buzzing you have access to sometimes is! smells & taste & touch work, sound does not, sight also doesn't. 
    - (disclaimer: have not been able to reach most jhanas, or taste them). late jhanas might be good for this

some general thoughts:

- most advice is fake. the vast majority of people cannot emotionally self-regulate in "good" ways. my bar for "good" is like...nick cammarata? this is similar to the vast majority of stuff is bad actually, and i think living life noticing this & in accordance with it leads to higher returns in the long-run
- there's a perspective you can take where the solution to everything is "be happy" and "get better emotional regulation". want to solve fights with your partner? just increase your robustness and your understanding of their emotional state such that you can accomodate yourself to them. want to solve motivation issues? just work on things you actually want to work on. want to solve things in your life going wrong? well, you're already tracking them. the reason why they're going wrong is because you don't have the capacity to act on them (or your judgement is clouded because your tracker prioritizes quick fixes (neuroticism)). I'm pretty sympathetic to this view. fix the self and everything else will come. become eNlIgHtEnEd
- understanding is still underrated. the alpha in *actually paying attention* to things and *actually paying attention* to the way you experience things and the way your brain works and what other people are saying is almost unfathomable? the alpha in *reading religious texts* is also extremely high. 
- internet has more wrong takes than ppl from antiquity. antiquity just wins for rules by how to live life. but Christianity was a good innovation you should take note of, discarding it just because it's your native tradition is bad
