To my future self,

Why do you dwell? For I cannot imagine a reason for you to be here if not to dwell, and you and I both know (perhaps you better than I) that rumination is the mind-killer. What's done is done, and what's done is to be dealt with. So go and live the life I want to lead. 

Why do you reminisce? I understand you are freed from the shackles of your past, yet you still choose to revisit it. "Hear ye, hear ye, thar be diamonds in these sands!" Dangerous sands, deceptively deep sands. Don't lose your way, don't get lost along the way. You would be better served calling an old friend.

Why do you wish to remember? Understand that there are a thousand bad reasons for remembering and only really one or two good ones. Your presence here is an indulgence. (My presence here is an indulgence). "History is doomed to repeat itself, if only because the world is comprised of illiterate rabble." Come on. You know better than to apply that to yourself.

So get up. Get up and live. Don't waste your time on remembering who I was. Some things are meant to be written by posterity not read---and this is one of those.

I'm on a flight to see Arjun's high school graduation. It's a bit surreal, really. I haven't been back to Temecula in about half a year, and I haven't spent more than two weeks cumulatively at home over the last year. Is it really my home at that point? I have a room, I guess. Just no friends. Maybe if I was a little bit better at having friends my life would be utterly different. 

If I was sixteen again, should I have gone to ESPR? I suppose this is the million-dollar question. My current guess is that ESPR counterfactually made me a little bit dumber, quite a bit less legible, much more world-weary and much happier. Accelerated character development camp for the win! (I don't think ASPR was quite like this, or that ASPR will have quite this effect on people). Bucketing this as "hopefully most of the benefits are realized in the long-term." Although you'd be a better judge of that than I :3
