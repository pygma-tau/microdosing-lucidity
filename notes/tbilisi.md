[[*Cities*](/cities)]

Without a doubt my favorite city on the planet.

Georgia is a gem. It has mountains! Wine! Temples! Skies! Wouldn't be surprised if the first skyhook was built here, although that's quite unlikely for geopolitical reasons. But the vibes. The vibes are *immaculate*.

The city center has levels! Dense levels! Soviet-era tunnels, brilliant libraries, and tasteful cafes! Prime urbex territory.

TurboBurger is good. 

For some reason, [this is its song](https://open.spotify.com/track/4AIazttPmHpd7p7pwJw692?si=8220a04b430c418b). [And this one](https://open.spotify.com/track/1UZb8ScApfiIKYvD6OLZxn?si=4604d8648e2140ea). [This one](https://open.spotify.com/track/0ct6r3EGTcMLPtrXHDvVjc?si=603e5e891fc54a84) is less Tbilisi and more a reflection of my mental state in Tbilisi.
