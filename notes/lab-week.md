# Monday

this day is focused a lot on focused research organizations 

## Forest Neurotech -- Summer Noman

neurotech past present and future

What is a BCI? A "brain-computer interface" that reads data from the CNS & then loops it back via typical input processes. Another way is with closed-loop neurostimulation, where a computer reads data from the brain and then intervenes on brain states. 

Not talking about:

- genetic modifications
- connectomics
- WBE
- pharmaceuticals

current intracortical BCI is nearing the level of performance of an unimpaired person at various tasks (video gaming)

neuralink is great because it has wireless telemetry & charging

paradromics & blackrock neurotech are driving for the field of electrophysiology based mototronics

surface cortical BCI---allows for speech synthesized from brain activity, by analyzing surface neuron activity over the motor cortex. from the motor cortex, you can then feed it into a neural network and this works well. (silent speech)

limitations today:

- neurotech today can really only treat parkinson's via the motor cortex
- many disorders, many systems associated with them. 
- e.g. depression: the brain networks associated with depression are varied & change over time

what do you need for the future? whole brain I/O

scaling electrodes is not really a good way to do this

but you can do this with ultrasound I/O: functional ultrasound imaging & focused ultrasound neuromodulation

nishimoto et al. 2011 did video recreation of what is seen via i guess the visual cortext?

ML + BCI

three elements of a good dataset:

- quality
- diversity
- quantity

optogenetics is better today but sonic based methods can penetrate much better through tissue
