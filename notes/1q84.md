*by Haruki Murakami*

blessing and a curse to have accidentally picked up an edition with only the first two books, as opposed to all three. don't think I'll read the third for a while though<br/><br/>i appreciate the characterization of Tengo: unambitious fiction-writing mathematician turned cram-school teacher. it captures a particular overlooked twist on the 'genius' narrative<br/><br/>yet it's absurdly superficial? the women in the novel read as if they're written by a pseudo-intellectual teenage boy, with character traits 1) in service to the plot and 2) predicated on sexual taboos. there are no *novel* archetypes, no recognition that perhaps some things are better off living between the lines, and the core relationship is predicated on a <i>love story of ten-year olds??</i><br/><br/>does the final installment have any interesting subversions? maybe I'm over-primed for Japanese pop fiction, but jesus christ
