Woke up at around 7:30. Got up at 7:45. Showered, went to breakfast at Hotel Trio. Had breakfast with Niccolo Zanichelli (Uzay reached out to him? follow up). Decided not to masturbate, but spent 20-30m in the Trio bathroom anyway. Want to not masturbate to have energy. Currently going on 24hrs w/o masturbation.

Being horny is kind of nice? Gives you energy. Interacting with cute girls becomes really fun and you can get really happy. But having this omnipresent is really annoying, esp. when Lydia is on the other side of the world. And it also feels really disgusting whenever I ruminate on it, because it feels like some kind of infidelity? But I didn't choose it, and I really can't control it, so the best I can do is not lean into it & keep myself out of situations where it would cause bad outcomes. 

Had a dilemma about whether or not I wanted to go to the human-AI interaction talks at the art gallery or stay at Trio and wait for Janine to pick me up to help do meal prep. The talks seemed really relevant! And I want to talk to Evan about doing contract work for Atlas Computing. (Transport is high cost/limited to certain times because someone stole my bike :(( (will try to find)).

But! BITS CommuniTea was at 9am today, and attending that is great & I can do that best from Trio. Notes on BITS CommuniTea (focusing on Adam Rupe's paper [On principles of emergent organization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157324001327)). 

- can you find a physics of neuroscience? physics seems to have more people asserting grand unified theories. maybe this because physicists are less jaded. Adam Shai shifted from neuro to AI alignment because it seems like we can get better perspectives on the nature of intelligence this way
- comp mech seems like a great tool for analyzing "world models". unify comp mech and oracle stuff?
- "not too many people know compmech". 
- Paul Riechers is a "chill guy who uses chill words to describe cool concepts"

Ok. Now at Janine's house 20m out of Trio in Healsburg. Is a farm, also seems to be where the Edge team is staying? Didn't have time to buy ingredients to meal prep, and also meal prep seems like it's not actually that useful when we have $9.99 burritos from Big John's Market. Zelda & Denisa are here, and we're probably going to cowork for the next hour or two? And then head down to city center to participate in cool events :D (need to talk to Evan)

Will work on cooperation writeups now! I want a lot of crisp mathematical results to *showcase my mathematical prowess*. Thinking about having an overview/motivation post, "Full-stack Cooperation", then a post on Modeling Probabilistic Logic & representing old program equilibria takes in the context of this (maybe a bit about turning finding equilibria into satisfiability problems), then a post on computing ths---with more esoteric things about interpreting bounded oracles as logical inductors (calling logical inductors?). Then maybe the actual cooperation results building the SAT solvers. In the oracle <-> inductor post, I need to flesh out the implementation of the Curry-Howard correspondence (youcan represent the oracle machine as a logical sentence!!). 

To-do today: 

- draft the motivation post
- draft the probabilistic logic post? 
- or draft the inductors post. I think that might have more meat

ooh I also need to respond to Lydia. Will do now. 

Got kidnapped by Anson to work on the A-Frame 20m drive! out of Healdsburg. It was really cool. California forests are amazing! Although it was really hot. Also, chocolate with almond butter is very underrated.

Right now I'm at an ARIA talk. 800mGBP funding!! ~$1bn funding!! I wish I could be a programme director. But the pathway for me is to just keep working & doing things, and I'm excited about tomorrow (want paper & pen). I wonder what lets them fund stuff outside the UK. Can we get something like this in America? Why am I so tied to doing the best thing vs. the second best thing.

Janus's Simulators post is very, very good. I want to write up a post detailing the similarities between the comp mech perspective and the simulators perspective. Can't do math on a computer. Have to have something to write with. Remarkable kind of works, should buy stylus. Need to send info to Chris.

Sigh.
