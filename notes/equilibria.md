types:

- Nash equilibrium
- correlated equilibrium
- [quasi-perfect equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-perfect_equilibrium)---refinement of Nash for extensive form games, considers opponent mistake-making
- [sequential equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_equilibrium)---refinement of Nash for extensive form games under incomplete information
- [trembling hand perfect equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trembling_hand_perfect_equilibrium)---players may choose unintended strategies
- perfect Bayesian equilibrium
- symmetric equilibrium
- Nash barganing solution
- competitive equilibrium
- static equilibrium
- dynamic equilibrium

folk theorems guarantee nash equilibria under certain conditions. e.g., there are various folk theorems for finite/infinte games with discounted/non-discounted rewards

superrational equilibria is one here. lobian cooperation

also program equilibria is a thing. [here](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/coesterh/AnnotatedProgEqBibliography.html) is a massive list of literature related to it
