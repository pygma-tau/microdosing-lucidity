title: Bubbles

[[*Notes*](\notes)]

Was observing a weird shaker-device in Schelling. Is composed of water, various types of sand, red brittle, and air. However, the air coalsesces into bubbles, and we don't know where the bubble film came from. 

Perhaps there are impurities on the sand (some sort of oil) that cause the membranes to form? How do these membranes typically form? IIRC it requires some kind of soap?
