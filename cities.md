Below are the half-deranged rambles of a man who enjoys making sweeping cultural claims and thereafter judging them on the basis of his own aesthetics. These reflections are in roughly reverse chronological order, and are all entirely first drafts (I hate editing, and as it is not strictly necessary to edit these I will not do so).

If you find any particularly compelling, feel free to [email me](mailto:kumar.yudhister@proton.me)! Likewise if you want to argue.

(there are also depressingly many placeholders here. I'll get to all of them someday)
