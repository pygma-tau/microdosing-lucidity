<p>The Probabilistic Payorâ€™s Lemma implies the following cooperation strategy:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A_{1}, \ldots, A_{n}\)</span> be agents in a multiplayer Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma, with the ability to return either â€˜Cooperateâ€™ or â€˜Defectâ€™ (which we model as the agents being logical statements resolving to either â€˜Trueâ€™ or â€˜Falseâ€™). Each <span class="math inline">\(A_{i}\)</span> behaves as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
\, \vdash \Box_{p_{i}} \left( \Box_{\max \{p_{1},\ldots, p_{n}\}}\bigwedge_{k=1}^n A_{k} \to \bigwedge_{k=1}^n A_{k} \right) \to A_{i}
\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span> represents each individual agentsâ€™ threshold for cooperation (as a probability in <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>), <span class="math inline">\(\Box_p \, \phi\)</span> returns True if credence in the statement <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is greater than <span class="math inline">\(p,\)</span> and the conjunction of <span class="math inline">\(A_{1}, \ldots, A_{n}\)</span> represents â€˜everyone cooperatesâ€™. Then, by the PPL, all agents cooperate (provided that all <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}_{A_{i}}\)</span> give credence to the cooperation statement greater than each and every <span class="math inline">\(A_{i}\)</span>â€™s individual thresholds for cooperation).</p>
<p>This formulation is desirable for a number of reasons: firstly, the Payorâ€™s Lemma is much simpler to prove than Lobâ€™s Theorem, and doesnâ€™t carry with it the same strange consequences as a result of asserting an arbitrary modal-fixedpoint; second, when we relax the necessitation requirement from â€˜provabilityâ€™ to â€˜beliefâ€™, this gives us behavior much more similar to how agents actually I read it as it emphasizing the notion of â€˜evidenceâ€™ being important.</p>
<p>However, the consistency of this â€˜p-beliefâ€™ modal operator rests on the self-referential probabilistic logic proposed by Christiano 2012, which, while being consistent, has a few undesirable properties: the distribution over sentences automatically assigns probability 1 to all True statements and 0 to all False ones (meaning it can only really model uncertainty for statements not provable within the system).</p>
<p>I propose that we can transfer the intuitions we have from probabilistic modal logic to a setting where â€˜p-beliefâ€™ is analogous to calling a â€˜reflective oracleâ€™, and this system gets us similar (or identical) properties of cooperation.</p>
<h1 id="oracles">Oracles</h1>
<p>A <em>probabilistic oracle</em> <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> is a function from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N} \to [0,1]^\mathbb{N}.\)</span> Here, its domain is meant to represent an indexing of <em>probabilistic oracle machines,</em> which are simply Turing machines allowed to call an oracle for input. An oracle can be queried with tuples of the form <span class="math inline">\((M, p),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a probabilistic oracle machine and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is a rational number between 0 and 1. By Fallenstein et. al. 2015, there exists a <em>reflective oracle</em> on each set of queries such that <span class="math inline">\(O(M,p) = 1\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}(M() = 1) &gt; p,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(O(M,p) = 0\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}(M() = 0) &lt; 1-p\)</span> (check this).</p>
<p>Notice that a reflective oracle has similar properties to the <span class="math inline">\(Bel\)</span> operator in self-referential probabilistic logic. It has a coherent probability distribution over probabilistic oracle machines (as opposed to sentences), it only gives information about the probability to arbitrary precision via queries (<span class="math inline">\(O(M,p)\)</span> vs.Â <span class="math inline">\(Bel(\phi)\)</span>). So, it would be great if there was a canonical method of relating the two.</p>
<p>Peano Arithmetic is Turing-complete, there exists a method of embedding arbitrary Turing machines in statements in predicate logic and there also exist various methods for embedding Turing machines in PA. We can form a correspondence where implications are preserved: notably, <span class="math inline">\(x\to y\)</span> simply represents the program <code>if TM(x), then TM(y)</code> , and negations just make the original TM output 1 where it outputted 0 and vice versa.</p>
<p>(Specifically, weâ€™re identifying non-halting Turing machines with propositions and operations on those propositions with different ways of composing the component associated Turing machines. Roughly, a Turing machine outputting 1 on an input is equivalent to a given sentence being true on that input)</p>
<p>CDT, expected utility maximizing agents with access to the same reflective oracle will reach Nash equilibria, because reflective oracles can <em>model other oracles</em> and <em>other oracles that are called by other probabilistic oracle machines</em>â€”so, at least in the unbounded setting, we donâ€™t have to worry about infinite regresses, because the oracles are guaranteed to halt.</p>
<p>So, we can consider the following bot:
<span class="math display">\[
A_{i} := O_{i} \left( O_{\bigcap i} \left( \bigwedge_{k=1}^n A_{k}\right) \to \bigwedge_{k=1}^n A_{k}, \, p_{i}\right),
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> is an agent represented by a oracle machine, <span class="math inline">\(O_i\)</span> is the probabilistic oracle affiliated with the agent, <span class="math inline">\(O_{\bigcap i}\)</span> is the closure of all agentsâ€™ oracles, and <span class="math inline">\(p_{i} \in \mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]\)</span> is an individual probability threshold set by each agent.</p>
<p>How do we get these closures? Well, ideally <span class="math inline">\(O_{\bigcap i}\)</span> returns <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> for queries <span class="math inline">\((M,p)\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; \min\{p_{M_1}, \ldots, p_{M_n}\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; \max \{p_{M_1}, \ldots, p_{M_n}\},\)</span> and randomizes for queries in the middleâ€”for the purposes of this cooperation strategy, this turns out to work.</p>
<p>I claim this set of agents has the same behavior as those acting in accordance with the PPL: they will all cooperate if the â€˜evidenceâ€™ for cooperating is above each agentsâ€™ individual threshold <span class="math inline">\(p_i.\)</span> In the previous case, the â€˜evidenceâ€™ was the statement <span class="math inline">\(\Box_{\max \{p_{1},\ldots, p_{n}\}}\bigwedge_{k=1}^n A_{k} \to \bigwedge_{k=1}^n A_{k}.\)</span> Here, the evidence is the statement <span class="math inline">\(O_{\bigcap i} \left( \bigwedge_{k=1}^n A_{k}\right) \to \bigwedge_{k=1}^n A_{k}.\)</span></p>
<p>To flesh out the correspondence further, we can show that the relevant properties of the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-belief operator are found in reflective oracles as well: namely, that instances of the weak distribution axiom schema are coherent and that necessitation holds.</p>
<p>For necessitation, <span class="math inline">\(\vdash \phi \implies \vdash \Box_{p}\phi\)</span> turns into <span class="math inline">\(M_{\phi}() = 1\)</span> implying that <span class="math inline">\(O(M_{\phi},p)=1,\)</span> which is true by the properties of reflective oracles. For weak distributivity, <span class="math inline">\(\vdash \phi \to \psi \implies \vdash \Box_{p} \phi \to \Box_{p}\psi\)</span> can be analogized to â€™if it is true that the Turing machine associated with <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> outputs 1 implies that the Turing machine associated with <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> outputs 1, then you should be at least <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>-certain that <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span>-outputs 1, so <span class="math inline">\(O(M_{\phi},p)\)</span> should imply <span class="math inline">\(O(M_{\psi}, p)\)</span> in all cases (because oracles represent true properties of probabilistic oracle machines, which Turing machines can be embedded into).</p>
<h1 id="models">Models</h1>
<p>Moreover, we can consider oracles to be a rough model of the p-belief modal language in which the probabilistic Payorâ€™s Lemma holds. We can get an explicit model to ensure consistency (see the links with Christianoâ€™s system, as well as its interpretation in neighborhood semantics), but oracles seem like a good intuition pump because they actively admit queries of the same form as <span class="math inline">\(Bel(\phi)&gt;p,\)</span> and they are a nice computable analog.</p>
<p>Theyâ€™re a bit like the probabilistic logic in the sense that a typical reflective oracle just has full information about what the output of a Turing machine will be if it halts, and the probabilistic logic gives <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}(\phi)=1\)</span> to all sentences which are deducible from the set of tautologies in the language. So the correspondence has some meat.</p>
