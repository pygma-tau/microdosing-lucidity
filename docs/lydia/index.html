<p>my journal to u</p>
<h1 id="section">2024-05-10</h1>
<p>was talking with Switch today, after we stopped talking. Sent her the evangelion song to start a conversation. I thought it would be good? and it was, when we talked about music. but jesus christ she is a cesspit??</p>
<p>like, she climbed on the roof to get attention?? and she’s 17/18?? smth smth just grow up, smth smth this is not behavior we should be encouraging, smth smth this is just actively bad for her and she needs authority figures who she can actually trust to put limits on her behavior?? she needs someone who can actually tell her why having a pity-party 24/7 is bad??</p>
<p>i cannot believe you told her that she was intentionally brought as a “high-variance individual.” THIS IS VERY BAD FOR PEOPLE LIKE THIS. it plays into their internal narratives and gives them external validation from the people who they actually respect, which makes it much much harder for them to excise the bad wiring from their brain.</p>
<p>Dai was valuable to me precisely because he <em>killed</em> all of this. utterly excised it. looked at it, looked at me, and called me fake to my face. it destroyed me. but this is good and this is what should be done?? / these people shouldn’t be coddled, they should be jailbroken</p>
<p>but she’s just not strong enough to handle being jailbroken. sigh. this is really sad. I legitimately cannot believe this person is my age, jesus christ. she’s just so….broken? focused on the wrong things? sad? a tarpit of despair? desparing about the wrong things? intentionally making herself miserable all the time? and the reason why she’s miserable is because she’s making herself miserable</p>
<p>i feel so sorry for her. so sorry. i’m quite mad at you for how you handled this? like i think you coddled her too much and this was really bad for her? and you had a really, really good chance to change her life for the better, to make her stronger, rather than letting her give into her victim complex</p>
<p>sigh. it’s alright. i’ll edit this when sending it to you bc i don’t really endorse the tone. but jesus FUCKING CHRIST this girl SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO BE A JC until she FUCKING FIGURES HERSELF OUT</p>
<p>AAAAARGH I HATE PEOPLE LIKE HER I HATE THE WORLD I AM ANTSY I SHOULD MAYBE GO OUTSIDE</p>
