<p>fuck celeste is hot</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2025-05-13</h1>
<p>i don’t know how i feel about you taking maximal advantage of institutions. it feels like a lot of the advantages you’ve had in your life have just existed because you were able to wrap institutions around your finger? when you actually weren’t deserving of it or something</p>
<p>like you are just very fine and sane in airports now (i predict). you just managed to get rid of your blockers. and this is what you should have done years ago, except institutions kept legitimizing your bad behavior</p>
<p>i feel this strongly in this place w.r.t. your extra tutorials and the fact that you get to take mocks ??? like jesus christ that’s lucky, but also i guess a function of merton. and you get extra time on your exams??? like ofc you’ll score highly because of that, i don’t know what else to do about it</p>
<p>i’ve been trying to write you playlists. why can’t you just understand that you can just look at the first letter of every word smh</p>
<p>well, this won’t be conducive to you actually doing good work. so like, cope i guess</p>
<p>you have to learn how to be self sufficient. the world doesn’t reward laziness. but it does make free riders godo</p>
<h1 id="section-2">2024-05-10</h1>
<p>was talking with Switch today, after we stopped talking. Sent her the evangelion song to start a conversation. I thought it would be good? and it was, when we talked about music. but jesus christ she is a cesspit??</p>
<p>like, she climbed on the roof to get attention?? and she’s 17/18?? smth smth just grow up, smth smth this is not behavior we should be encouraging, smth smth this is just actively bad for her and she needs authority figures who she can actually trust to put limits on her behavior?? she needs someone who can actually tell her why having a pity-party 24/7 is bad??</p>
<p>i cannot believe you told her that she was intentionally brought as a “high-variance individual.” THIS IS VERY BAD FOR PEOPLE LIKE THIS. it plays into their internal narratives and gives them external validation from the people who they actually respect, which makes it much much harder for them to excise the bad wiring from their brain.</p>
<p>Dai was valuable to me precisely because he <em>killed</em> all of this. utterly excised it. looked at it, looked at me, and called me fake to my face. it destroyed me. but this is good and this is what should be done?? / these people shouldn’t be coddled, they should be jailbroken</p>
<p>but she’s just not strong enough to handle being jailbroken. sigh. this is really sad. I legitimately cannot believe this person is my age, jesus christ. she’s just so….broken? focused on the wrong things? sad? a tarpit of despair? desparing about the wrong things? intentionally making herself miserable all the time? and the reason why she’s miserable is because she’s making herself miserable</p>
<p>i feel so sorry for her. so sorry. i’m quite mad at you for how you handled this? like i think you coddled her too much and this was really bad for her? and you had a really, really good chance to change her life for the better, to make her stronger, rather than letting her give into her victim complex</p>
<p>sigh. it’s alright. i’ll edit this when sending it to you bc i don’t really endorse the tone. but jesus FUCKING CHRIST this girl SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO BE A JC until she FUCKING FIGURES HERSELF OUT</p>
<p>AAAAARGH I HATE PEOPLE LIKE HER I HATE THE WORLD I AM ANTSY I SHOULD MAYBE GO OUTSIDE</p>
