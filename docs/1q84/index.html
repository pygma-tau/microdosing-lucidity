<p><em>by Haruki Murakami</em></p>
<p>[<a href="../texts"><em>Texts</em></a>]</p>
<p>blessing and a curse to have accidentally picked up an edition with only the first two books, as opposed to all three. don’t think I’ll read the third for a while though<br /><br />i appreciate the characterization of Tengo: unambitious fiction-writing mathematician turned cram-school teacher. it captures a particular overlooked twist on the ‘genius’ narrative<br /><br />yet it’s absurdly superficial? the women in the novel read as if they’re written by a pseudo-intellectual teenage boy, with character traits 1) in service to the plot and 2) predicated on sexual taboos. there are no <em>novel</em> archetypes, no recognition that perhaps some things are better off living between the lines, and the core relationship is predicated on a <i>love story of ten-year olds??</i><br /><br />does the final installment have any interesting subversions? maybe I’m over-primed for Japanese pop fiction, but jesus christ</p>
