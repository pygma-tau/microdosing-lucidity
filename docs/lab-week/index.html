<h1 id="monday">Monday</h1>
<p>this day is focused a lot on focused research organizations</p>
<h2 id="forest-neurotech-summer-noman">Forest Neurotech – Summer Noman</h2>
<p>neurotech past present and future</p>
<p>What is a BCI? A “brain-computer interface” that reads data from the CNS &amp; then loops it back via typical input processes. Another way is with closed-loop neurostimulation, where a computer reads data from the brain and then intervenes on brain states.</p>
<p>Not talking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>genetic modifications</li>
<li>connectomics</li>
<li>WBE</li>
<li>pharmaceuticals</li>
</ul>
<p>current intracortical BCI is nearing the level of performance of an unimpaired person at various tasks (video gaming)</p>
<p>neuralink is great because it has wireless telemetry &amp; charging</p>
<p>paradromics &amp; blackrock neurotech are driving for the field of electrophysiology based mototronics</p>
<p>surface cortical BCI—allows for speech synthesized from brain activity, by analyzing surface neuron activity over the motor cortex. from the motor cortex, you can then feed it into a neural network and this works well. (silent speech)</p>
<p>limitations today:</p>
<ul>
<li>neurotech today can really only treat parkinson’s via the motor cortex</li>
<li>many disorders, many systems associated with them.</li>
<li>e.g. depression: the brain networks associated with depression are varied &amp; change over time</li>
</ul>
<p>what do you need for the future? whole brain I/O</p>
<p>scaling electrodes is not really a good way to do this</p>
<p>but you can do this with ultrasound I/O: functional ultrasound imaging &amp; focused ultrasound neuromodulation</p>
<p>nishimoto et al. 2011 did video recreation of what is seen via i guess the visual cortext?</p>
<p>ML + BCI</p>
<p>mindeye2</p>
<p>three elements of a good dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li>quality</li>
<li>diversity</li>
<li>quantity</li>
</ul>
<p>optogenetics is better today but sonic based methods can penetrate much better through tissue</p>
