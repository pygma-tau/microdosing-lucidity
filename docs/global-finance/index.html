<p>TL;DR: America is losing its financial dominance. It’s possible to conduct business without ever routing through American commercial networks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Start with the countries that have marched determinedly towards self-sufficiency, rather than rely on the vagaries of global capital. The most important such bloc comprises the victims of the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. What began with a speculative attack on Thailand’s baht, then pegged unsustainably to the American dollar, quickly became a financial and economic typhoon that swept through much of South-East Asia, South Korea and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The crisis was so damaging in part because corporate and financial-sector debt had risen rapidly in the years beforehand. Much was borrowed from overseas, at short-term maturities and in foreign currency. When Thailand’s exchange-rate peg splintered in July 1997, it quickly became apparent just how risky this was. The central bank was forced to devalue the baht, causing the local-currency value of dollar debt to soar—a pattern which was then repeated in Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia. That alone would have been enough to send highly leveraged firms into distress or bankruptcy. But then global investors fled the region en masse, pulling out of positions indiscriminately. The result was a funding crisis in which short-term foreign debt could not be rolled over, leading to more defaults and the deepening of a multi-country economic slump.</p>
<p>In subsequent years, notes Clifford Lee, who runs the investment-banking division of dbs, South-East Asia’s biggest bank, policymakers in the region began to impose more controls on inbound investment. This limited firms’ access to capital, and hence their growth, but also prevented similar vulnerabilities from building up again. At the same time, notes Art Karoonyavanich, also of dbs, Asian governments were busy privatising and listing state-owned firms.</p>
The combination of capital controls, high savings rates and a series of “crown jewel” assets being listed, as Mr Karoonyavanich puts it, breathed life into the region’s own capital markets. Then, as much of the rest of the world fell into the financial crisis of 2007-09 and South-East Asia emerged relatively unscathed, governments started issuing big tranches of sovereign debt in their own currencies rather than in dollars. Now, says Mr Lee, bonds issued by Asian firms tend to be bought up regionally, as deep-pocketed domestic investors outbid counterparts in London and New York.

<p>America tightened its grip over foreign finance in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001. As the Treasury department searched for ways to prevent future attackers from accessing funding, it alighted on swift, a global financial co-operative whose messaging services facilitate large cross-border payments. Its data could be used to track transactions and uncover links between terrorists and financiers. The same sort of financial mapping helped the Treasury find other ties, too—between foreign banks and countries under American sanctions. The Patriot Act, another product of the 9/11 attacks, then gave the Treasury the power to drive such banks out of business.</p>
<p>This weapon was notably deployed in September 2005, against Macau’s Banco Delta Asia (bda), and then again in February 2018, against Latvia’s ablv Bank. Both times the real target was North Korea. The Treasury accused the banks of enabling the regime to break international law, in part by helping to fund its nuclear-weapons programme, and announced it was considering designating each bank a “prime money-laundering concern”. Under the Patriot Act, this step could lead to American banks being banned from providing “correspondent accounts” to bda and ablv, meaning they could no longer move dollars through America’s banking system. This would stop them from executing dollar transactions for their clients, effectively shutting them out of international finance. For other banks around the world, to continue doing business with BDA and ABLV would have been to risk designation as money launderers themselves.</p>
The effect in each case was immediate and dramatic. Global banks withdrew funds from both en masse. Within weeks of the Treasury’s announcements, each faced a liquidity crisis and had its management seized by its regulator. The collapses came so quickly that the Treasury’s accusations could not be challenged in court until it was too late. Now, with the help of an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in December 2023, the Treasury can dole out the same treatment to any foreign financial institutions deemed to be supporting Russia’s military-industrial base.

<blockquote>
<p>To assess whether fdi has also been redirected over time, the imf researchers analysed data on 300,000 new (or “greenfield”) cross-border investments carried out between 2003 and 2022. They found a rapid drop in flows to China after trade tensions ratcheted up in 2018. Between then and the end of 2022, China-bound fdi in sectors which policymakers deemed “strategic” fell by more than 50%. Strategic fdi flows to Europe and the rest of Asia fell, too, but by much less; those to America stayed relatively stable. fdi for China’s chip sector plunged by a factor of four, even as fdi for chip firms rose sharply in the rest of Asia and America.</p>
The imf researchers then compared investments in different regions completed between 2015 and 2020 with those completed between 2020 and 2022. From one time period to the next, average fdi flows declined by 20%. But the decline was extremely uneven across different regions. America and countries in Europe, especially its emerging economies, came out as relative winners. fdi to China and the rest of Asia fell by much more than the aggregate decline.
